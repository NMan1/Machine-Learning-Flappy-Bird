# Machine-Learning-Flappy-Bird
### Teaching a neural network to play flappy bird using NEAT.
Since flappy bird is quite a simple game, not many generations are needed for the neural network to get an excellent species going. As you can infer in the picture it didnt take long at all for the birds to become almost perfect.

In the configuration file you can adjust the starting populating, which is the amount of starting birds. More = faster species progress, Less = slower. If you start with 100, it'll take two/one generations for the birds to be perfect.
